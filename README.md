# SimpleRecorder
a simple Objective-C streaming audio recorder.

## Why SimpleRecorder?

When I was trying to implement an iOS app, I realized that there was something missing from the built-in libraries of Cocoa: a simple recorder that would return the audio stream and not just save a file (AVAudioRecordre), without needing to get your hands dirty (CoreAudio), so I coded up a suitable simple recorder and used it in my own project.
